    <p id="Nietzsche-text">
      Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher known for his radical ideas
      about morality, power, and the human will. He famously declared that "God
      is dead," arguing that traditional values were losing their meaning in
      modern society. His concepts of the Übermensch (Superman) and eternal
      recurrence challenge individuals to create their own purpose and live
      boldly. His work has influenced existentialism, psychology, and postmodern
      thought.

    <p id="Hegel-text">
      Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher who developed the
      idea of dialectics—where progress happens through contradictions being
      resolved. His philosophy emphasized that history unfolds through a process
      of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Hegel also saw reality as deeply
      connected, believing that everything is part of an evolving whole. His
      ideas shaped modern political theory, existentialism, and even Marxism.

    <p id="Camus-text">
      Albert Camus was a French philosopher and writer known for his philosophy
      of absurdism. He believed that life has no inherent meaning, but instead
      of despairing, we should embrace the absurd and live with passion. His
      famous works, such as The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus, explore
      themes of existential crisis and personal freedom. Camus rejected nihilism
      and instead encouraged finding joy in the simple act of living.
